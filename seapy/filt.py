def average_err(x, window=5):
    """
    Generate a moving (boxcar) average and variance of the time-series, x, using
    the specified window size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ndarray,
        The time-series of data to bandpass filter.
    cutoff: float,
        The period at which the bandpass filter will apply the cutoff. 
        Units are same as the time-step of the signal provided (e.g., if the
        data are provided every hour, then a cutoff=12 would be a 12 hour
        cutoff.)

    Returns
    -------
    x, variance: ndarray, ndarray
        Returns the moving average of x with the moving variance of the
        average window

    Examples
    --------
    Create data every 30 minutes for 3 days with time in days:

      >>>  t = np.linspace(0, 3.0, 2 * 24 * 3.0, endpoint=False)
      >>>  x = 0.1 * np.sin(2 * np.pi / .008 * t)
      >>>  x += 0.2 * np.cos(2 * np.pi / 0.6 * t + 0.1)
      >>>  x += 0.2 * np.cos(2 * np.pi / 1.6 * t + .11)
      >>>  x += 1 * np.cos(2 * np.pi / 10 * t + 11)

    Average the data over 6 hour period

      >>>  nx, err = average_err(x, window=12)
      >>>  plt.plot(t, x, 'k', t, nx, 'r', label=['Raw', 'Average'])
      >>>  plt.figure()
      >>>  plt.plot(t, err, 'g', label='Variance')

def bandpass(x, dt, low_cutoff=None, hi_cutoff=None, order=7):
    """
    Perform a bandpass filter at the cutoff period (same units as the
    time-series step).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x  : ndarray,
        The time-series of data to bandpass filter.
    dt : float,
        The time-step between the values in x. Units must be consistent
        with the cutoff period.
    low_cutoff: float,
        The period at which the bandpass filter will apply the lowpass filter. 
        Units are same as the time-step of the signal provided (e.g., if the
        data are provided every hour, then a cutoff=12 would be a 12 hour
        cutoff.) Everything that has a longer period will remain. If you only
        want a hi-pass filter, this value should be None.
    hi_cutoff: float,
        The period at which the bandpass filter will apply the high-pass filter. 
        Units are same as the time-step of the signal provided (e.g., if the
        data are provided every hour, then a cutoff=12 would be a 12 hour
        cutoff.) Everything that has a shorter period will remain. If you only
        want a low-pass filter, this value should be None.
    order: int optional,
        The order of the filter to apply

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        The bandpass filtered time-series

    Examples
    --------
    Create data every 30 minutes for 3 days with time in days:

      >>>  x += 1 * np.cos(2 * np.pi / 10 * t + 11)

      >>>  nx = bandpass(x, dt=0.5, low_cutoff=24 )
